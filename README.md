 🌟 This week, I have brought my Excel dashboard practice to an end and now the interactive Sales Dashboard is ready! 🚀

So I required something to monitor some essential sales indicators and to give an overview of sales dynamics, certain customers, and certain regions. 

That is what I have in mind:

📊 Total Sales, Avg Income  Per Purchase,Customer Age Brackets, Customer Commute.

🔍 Married Status,Region, Education, filters are useful in providing perfect interaction with the data set.

- Regional Performance displaying sales and profit by regions for comparison purposes.

💼 As a result of thisproject, I learned a great deal more about data visualization, and data and graphic interaction which are valuable skills for a data manager. 

💡 Check all the details on GitHub- the completed project:

If you’re interested in developing this kind of dashboard and/or analyzing your data, please don’t hesitate to get in touch – it would be great to exchange opinions, and I’d like to hear what is done in this area by other specialists! 🙌
